# TCP-IP-Chat-Client

This project works with the sockets API in the C programming language. I created a chat client that is able to communicate with a server. The client sensd messages to the server, which is then able to broadcast the message to all the other clients on the system. Similarly, the client receivse messages directly from the server, thus enabling the user to read messages sent by all other clients on the system.
